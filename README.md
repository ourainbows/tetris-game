# TETRIS GAME
In Tetris, players complete lines by moving pieces of different shapes (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and award points to the player, and the player can proceed to fill the vacant slots. The game ends when the playing field is filled. The longer the player can delay this result, the higher his score.
